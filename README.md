# Red-Black Tree Performance Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a C++ program implementing a Red-Black Tree data structure and measuring the performance of various functions associated with it.

## Red-Black Tree
A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance through color properties on its nodes, ensuring that the tree remains relatively balanced during insertions and deletions.

## Program Features
- Implementation of Red-Black Tree data structure.
- Performance analysis of key functions:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search
  - Tree traversal (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder)
  - Height calculation

## Performance Metrics
The program provides detailed metrics on the time complexity of each function, allowing for a thorough analysis of the Red-Black Tree's performance under different scenarios.
